JAVA SCRIPT

* JavaScript is a language.
node.js is not a language or a special dialect of JavaScript - it's just a thingamabob that runs normal JavaScript.

* All browsers have JavaScript engines that run the JavaScript of web pages. Firefox has an engine called Spidermonkey, 
Safari has JavaScriptCore, and Chrome has an engine called V8.

NODE JS

* Node.js is simply the V8 engine bundled with some libraries to do I/O and networking, 
so that you can use JavaScript outside of the browser, to create shell scripts, backend services or run on hardware.

* Nodejs is an interpreter and environment for javascript which includes a bunch of libraries for using javascript as a general-purpose programming language, 
with an emphasis on asynchronicity and non-blocking operations.
Node actually runs the same interpreter as Google Chrome (V8), but provides a different set of libraries and a different run-time environment. 
It also includes a package management system (NPM) and a few language extensions you won't find standard in browsers (for example modules).
